# Eâ€‘Commerceâ€‘Cart

ðŸ›’ **Eâ€‘Commerce Cart (Vite + React + Tailwind CSS)** A responsive shoppingâ€‘cart web app built with Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS. This project helped me gain handsâ€‘on experience with React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks, plus global state management via Context API and persisting data with `localStorage`. Users can browse a product list, add items to their cart, adjust quantities, remove products, and see the total update in real time.
